Adding the ellipse shape to my code. Calling functions and using random numbers to allow the position of the 2D shapes to be randomized every time the webpage is reloaded. We were also introduced to 'noStroke' for the shapes, but I prefer the outlines of them. To me, my code resembles some sort of 80s wall decor. I also wanted to use the 2D 'arc' shape, but was not sure which coordinates/measurements were needed for it to show.
